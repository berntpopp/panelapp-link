"""Logging filter that keeps external-framework caller input out of the log sink.

FastMCP core and the MCP SDK log the caller's OWN requested tool name / resource URI
/ prompt name (with any control/zero-width/bidi/NUL code points it carries) on their
OWN loggers, BEFORE this repo's :class:`InputValidationMiddleware` / the Layer-3
protocol backstop reshape the caller-facing frame. These records reflect caller input
into a log/telemetry sink independent of who the caller is. Examples (all real, on the
pinned FastMCP 3.4.x / mcp stack):

* ``fastmcp.server.server``                — ``Invalid arguments for tool %r: %s``
* ``fastmcp.server.mixins.mcp_operations`` — ``[<srv>] Handler called: call_tool %s
  with %s`` / ``... get_prompt %s ...`` / ``... read_resource %s`` (name/URI in args)
* ``mcp.server.lowlevel.server``           — ``Tool cache miss for %s, refreshing cache``
* ROOT (``mcp.shared.session`` bare ``logging.warning``) — ``Failed to validate
  request: <pydantic error with the raw URI>`` / ``Message that failed validation: …``

``mask_error_details=True`` masks the tool *response*, not these *log* records. This
filter neutralizes them at the SOURCE logger (a logging filter only runs for records
emitted on the logger it is attached to -- ancestor filters are skipped during
propagation), replacing the whole message and clearing ``args``/``exc_info`` so raw
caller input never lands in a log sink at ANY level (the fleet PII / log-hygiene
invariant), then a WARNING+ prefix fallback catches any other framework record whose
interpolated args carry caller-derived detail.
