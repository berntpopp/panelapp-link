"""Cross-process advisory lock that serializes database builds.

The entrypoint build, the in-process refresh scheduler, and any external cron or
sidecar all funnel through ``panelapp-link-data``/``refresh``. This lock ensures
only one of them crawls + rebuilds at a time, so they never clobber each other's
temp file.

Uses POSIX ``fcntl.flock`` on a lock file in the data directory. On platforms
without ``fcntl`` (e.g. Windows) it degrades to a no-op, which is acceptable
because the primary deployment target is Linux containers and the builder's
final ``os.replace`` is itself atomic.
