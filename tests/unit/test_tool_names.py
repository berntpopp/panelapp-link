"""Tool registration coverage and Tool-Naming Standard v1.1 compliance.

Backfills Rule 8 (CI verb guard) which was absent from panelapp-link.

The register_all_tools function must register EXACTLY the frozen TOOLS set,
and every name must be unprefixed snake_case starting with a ratified verb so it
composes cleanly behind a namespacing gateway (mounts under ``panelapp``).

Ratified verb canon (Tool-Naming Standard v1.1, 2026-06-30):
  Tier-1 (universal read/query): get search list resolve find compare compute map
  Tier-2 (domain action/compute): predict annotate recode liftover analyze score
                                   submit export generate download
  ops/meta tag carve-out: tools tagged ``ops`` or ``meta`` skip the verb rule
    (still must match charset/length/no-self-prefix).
